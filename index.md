Hi and welcome to my personal site![^1]

I am Javier, a Senior Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience.
In 2019, I relocated to London, UK, where I developed a strong interest in the fascinating and dynamic world of Financial Technology.

Currently, I work as a full-time **Engineering Team Lead** at [Yapily](https://www.yapily.com/).
I would like to invite you to review my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13EMTl_ubZ2lYAcElKREs6BSUIqUmNuuV/view) for more details about my professional journey and accomplishments.

Have a great day!

<br><br>
