Hi and welcome! I hope you enjoy my personal site![^1]

I am Javier a Senior Software Engineer with more than ten years of experience.
I started my IT journey in Argentina. Since 2019 I moved to London (UK) where I found the Financial Technologies very impressive and attractive.

I am currently working for [Yapily](https://www.yapily.com/) as a full-time **Senior Software Engineer**.
I would like to invite you to check my [resume](/resume/) to get more details about my professional career.
