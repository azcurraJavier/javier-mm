I enjoy riding my bike around the mountains in Argentina. Patagonia is my favourite place in our lovely Earth.
South-american or Italian food are impossible to resist from my side. Favourite instrument: Electric Organ.

I love travelling to explore new countries. I prefer the nature instead of the city. 
However, a calm coffee shop, jazz music and a good book in my hands is very welcome.

Passion for coding appears in early stages of my life when I was 17 years. I wrote my first program in Pascal when I was doing the first year of my Bachelor Computer Degree.

I grow up in small town in Argentina very close to the mountains. 
 
When I got my Italian passport on 2019, I planned to look for new opportunities in the United Kingdom.

I found Financial Technologies so attractive in London. Working in Yapily I made new friends, colleagues and meet fantastic people.
